## 2012-renderer
An open-source place renderer for the version ``0.69.0.646`` Roblox Studio version (compatible with later versions (this was for December 2012 originally))

## Usage
Compile the project in ``DEBUG`` mode (Release mode could cause issues)
Open the ``MFCStudio`` (RobloxApp clients are not compatible, no idea why)

## Functions
``render(filepath, x, y, url)``
Example: ``render("TestRender.png", 1280, 720, "http://www.roblox.com")``
The url is what the image gets sent to, leave this as a random VALID url if you don't want to do that.

```
